The premise was so interesting, and the story was well executed. It was a great combination of twists I didn’t see coming as well as story lines I could theorize about and figure out. There were two small drawbacks for me... I felt that the beginning was a bit slow, given that the audience knows more than the protagonists, and the main character repeated himself a lot, but those were so minor relative to the complexity that I’m willing to forgive. A great book... read it with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed sharing our theories with each other as the story progressed. Definitely would recommend!",,,1,1

I had a very complicated relationship with this book. I read The Heart’s Invisible Furies last year, and was really looking forward to reading more of John Boyne. <br/><br/>That being said, I did not like this book. I didn’t enjoy the read. However, I also don’t think it’s a bad story—rather, Boyne tells the story so well that you’re left with a mix of pity and revulsion for almost all of the major characters. You spend the entire book waiting for the new and terrible things that will inevitably come at you. I hated, HATED Maurice Swift. He was awful. But was the writing bad if the book makes you feel powerful, albeit negative emotions?<br/><br/>Ultimately, I don’t think I can truly judge the book of what I felt about it. If I were giving it stars based on how the characters made me feel, it would be a one star review. If I were giving it stars based on how deeply it made me feel those feelings, I’d give it five. I’m settling in the middle at three. Others may like it better than me, and I might even recommend it—just be prepared.",,,1,1
