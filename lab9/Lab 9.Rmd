## Goals

The goal of this lab is to help you review topics we've covered this quarter.

## Concept Review

In the next few sections, you will review what we learned in class by using a few interactive widgets. Investigate the best choices of models, variables, transformations, and hyperparameters and then answer the questions that follow.

### Reviewing Regression

Use the widget below to review what we learned about multiple linear regression:

x4 <- rbinom(n,7,.3)
x5 <- rnorm(n,10,2)
y <- (3 + 2*x1 - 1.5*x2 + 0.5*x3 + x5)^2 + x3^4 + 6*x3*x5 + x5^3 + rnorm(n)

Discuss with a neighbor (or on Ed):

1. Which transformation, if any, would you choose for this dataset?
2. What degree of polynomial features would you choose?
3. Does regularization improve performance?
4. Which produces better results LASSO or Ridge Regression?
5. What value of the regularization penalty produces the best results for LASSO? For Ridge Regression?
6. Overall, what combination of choices gets you the best performance? Write the metrics for your best model on the board next to your group number. Can you outperform other groups?

```

Discuss with a neighbor (or on Ed):

1. As the threshold changes, how does this affect model performance?
2. What threshold gets you the highest accuracy? sensitivity? specificity?
3. Why did we use Logistic Regression instead of KNN to illustrate this?
4. Are there changes we could make to our KNN algorithm that would allow us to get a probability so that we can choose a threshold?

Discuss with a neighbor (or on Ed):

1. What value of K would you choose for K-Means clustering? Why? Does your answer change depending on the distance metric you choose?
2. What happens when you use single linkage for hierarchical clustering? Does changing the distance/dissimilarity metric help?
3. What happens when you use centroid linkage for hierarchical clustering? Does changing the distance/dissimilarity metric help?
4. Which linkage and dissimilary pair seems to produce the most balanced dendrogram?
5. Where would you cut this dendrogram to create the same number of clusters you chose for K-Means?
6. Based on the dendrogram, would you choose the same number of clusters as you used for K-Means? Why or why not?

## Implementation Review

Now that we've reminded ourselves of the concepts we learned this quarter, let's implement some of them in Python.

### Setup

For this lab we will be using `plotnine`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, and the dataset `msleep`.

```{python setup-packages, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotnine as p9
import scipy
import sklearn

# To download this file go to https://posit.ds.uchicago.edu/data119-lab9/www/msleep.csv

msleep = pd.read_csv("./data/msleep.csv")
msleep.head()
```

This dataset has 83 rows and 11 variables and contains information about sleep times for various mammals taken from V. M. Savage and G. B. West. *A quantitative, theoretical framework for understanding mammalian sleep.* Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104 (3):1051-1056, 2007. The variables and their descriptions are listed below:

- `name`: common name
- `genus`
- `vore`: carnivore, omnivore or herbivore?
- `order`
- `conservation`: the conservation status of the animal
- `sleep_total`: total amount of sleep, in hours
- `sleep_rem`: rem sleep, in hours
- `sleep_cycle`: length of sleep cycle, in hours
- `awake`: amount of time spent awake, in hours
- `brainwt`: brain weight in kilograms
- `bodywt`: body weight in kilograms

You can use the following cell to explore the data>

```{python explore, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

### Modeling `sleep_total`

We want to learn if there are certain variables that we can use to help predict how long a mammal will sleep.

```{r q1, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "What type of model should I use?",
  answer("Supervised", correct = TRUE, message = "That's right! Since we have values for a response variable that we can use to build the model and calculate a loss/error, we would use supervised learning."),
  answer("Unsupervised", message = "Not quite. Unsupervised learning does not involve a response variable."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  post_message = "There are two main types of supervised Learning: regression and classification. Do you remember when to use each?"
)
```

```{r q2, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "More specifically, which model should I use?",
  answer("KNN",  message = "Not quite. KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) is a classification algorithm which does not allow us to model continuous response variables."),
  answer("Simple linear regression", message = "Very close! Simple linear regression allows us to model a continuous response variable. But, it only allows us to use one predictor and I want to investigate more than one..."),
  answer("Multiple linear regression", correct = TRUE, message = "Correct! Multiple linear regresison will allow us to model a continuous response variable using multiple features."),
  answer("Logistic regression", message = "Not quite. Even though regression is in the name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm which does not allow us to model continuous response variables."),
  answer("K-Means", message = "Not quite. K-Means is a method of clustering which is an unsupervised learning algorithm."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Now, that we've narrowed down the type of model we want to build, we need to check that our data meets the model assumptions. Remember that MLR assumes the response variable is normally distributed. Use the next cell to check this assumption:

```{python sleep_hist, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
(p9.ggplot(msleep, p9.aes(x = ___)) +
  p9.geom_histogram(bins = 24))
```

```{python sleep_hist-solution, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
(p9.ggplot(msleep, p9.aes(x = sleep_total)) +
  p9.geom_histogram(bins = 24))
```

```{r sleep_hist-code-check, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
grade_this_code()
```

```{r q3, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "Does the data meet this assumption?",
  answer("Yes!",  message = ""),
  answer("No...", message = ""),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Now, we need to choose which variables to include in our model. Before you do any additional analysis, are there any variables you would be concerned about including in the model based on the descriptions?  

```{r q3, echo=FALSE}
question_checkbox(
  "Select the variables that you are concerned about including in the model. ",
  answer("name"),
  answer("genus"),
  answer("vore"),
  answer("order"),
  answer("conservation"),
  answer("sleep_rem"),
  answer("sleep_cycle"),
  answer("awake"),
  answer("brain_wt"),
  answer("bodywt"),
  answer_fn(function(value) {
    correct("There are multiple correct answers to this question, but the variables I found concerning were name (unique for every animal) and sleep_rem, sleep_cycle, and awake (these should be highly related with sleep_total but might not help us learn much about what contributes to how much an animal sleeps). bodywt and brainwt might also be very similar to each other which could be an issue...")

Generate a correlation matrix for each potential numeric predictor variable.

```{python cormat, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
round(msleep[[ ___ ]].corr(), 3)
```

```{python cormat-solution, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
round(msleep[['sleep_rem','sleep_cycle','awake','brain_wt','bodywt']].corr(), 3)
```

```{r cormat-code-check, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
grade_this_code()
```

Now, let's one-hot-encode our categorical variables. Don't forget you need a reference level!

```{python dummy_drop, exercise = TRUE, message = FALSE, exercise.setup="setup2_5"}
msleep = pd.get_dummies(___, columns = ___, dtype = float, ___)
```

```{python dummy_drop-solution, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
msleep = pd.get_dummies(msleep, columns = ['genus', 'vore', 'order', 'conservation'], dtype = float, drop_first=True)
```

```{r dummy_drop-code-check, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
grade_this_code()
```

```{python setup1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
msleep = pd.get_dummies(msleep, columns = ['genus', 'vore', 'order', 'conservation'], dtype = float, drop_first=True)
```

We still need to do one more thing to help us decide which variables to use - calculate the VIF. Calculate the VIF for all potential predictor variables (don't include `name` or the response variable).

```{python vif, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
VIF_msleep = [variance_inflation_factor(msleep.drop(___).values, i) for i in range(len(___.columns))]
VIF_msleep_df = pd.DataFrame({"feature": ___.columns, "VIF": ___})
VIF_msleep_df
```

```{python vif-solution, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
VIF_msleep = [variance_inflation_factor(msleep.drop(columns=['name','sleep_total']).values, i) for i in range(len(msleep.drop(columns=['name','sleep_total']).columns))]
VIF_msleep_df = pd.DataFrame({"feature": msleep.drop(columns=['name','sleep_total']).columns, "VIF": VIF_msleep})
VIF_msleep_df
```

```{r vif-code-check, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
grade_this_code()
```

```{r q3, echo=FALSE}
question_checkbox(
  "After looking at your correlation matrix and VIFs, select the variables that you are concerned about including in the model. ",
  answer("genus"),
  answer("vore"),
  answer("order"),
  answer("conservation"),
  answer("sleep_rem"),
  answer("sleep_cycle"),
  answer("awake"),
  answer("brain_wt"),
  answer("bodywt"),
  answer_fn(function(value) {
    correct("There are multiple correct answers to this question, but the variables I found concerning were ")
  }),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Let's prepare our data to fit a regression model. Split the data into `X` and `y` where `X` contains the variables ABCDS and `y` contains the response variable. Then, use `train_test_split()` to create a training set with 70% of the data and a testing set with the remaining 30% of the data. Lastly, fit a `StandardScaler()` on the training set and us it to scale both the training and the testing sets. Make sure that you are only scaling the numeric variables.

```{python pp, exercise = FALSE, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, exercise.setup="setup1"}
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = ___
y = ___

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(___, random_state = 314)
                                                       
scaler = StandardScaler()

X_train_pp = X_train.copy()
X_test_pp = X_test.copy()

col_names = [___]
scaler.fit(___)
X_train_pp[col_names] = scaler.transform(___)

X_test_pp[col_names] = scaler.transform(___)
```

```{python pp-solution, exercise = FALSE, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, exercise.setup="setup1"}
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = msleep[[]]
y = msleep['sleep_total']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 314)
                                                       
scaler = StandardScaler()

X_train_pp = X_train.copy()
X_test_pp = X_test.copy()

col_names = []
scaler.fit(X_train_pp[col_names])
X_train_pp[col_names] = scaler.transform(X_train_pp[col_names])

X_test_pp[col_names] = scaler.transform(X_test_pp[col_names])
```

```{r solution-code-check, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
grade_this_code()
```

```{python setup2, exercise = FALSE, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, exercise.setup="setup1"}
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X = msleep[[]]
y = msleep['sleep_total']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 314)
                                                       
scaler = StandardScaler()

X_train_pp = X_train.copy()
X_test_pp = X_test.copy()

col_names = []
scaler.fit(X_train_pp[col_names])
X_train_pp[col_names] = scaler.transform(X_train_pp[col_names])

X_test_pp[col_names] = scaler.transform(X_test_pp[col_names])
```

Now that our data is pre-processed and ready to go, let's build a few models! First, build a multiple linear regression model without any regularization. Calculate the training and testing MSE.

Let's test the remaining MLR assumptions by making plots of the residuals.

Next, I want to see if regularization works well on this dataset. Use 5-fold cross validation to choose the best value of $\alpha$ for LASSO and Ridge Regression. What is the overall training and testing MSE for each model? 


Discuss with your neighbor (or on Ed):

* Which of these 3 models would you choose?

### Modeling `conservation`

Let's switch gears and look at a different variable. Does an animal's sleeping habits affect whether or not it is endangered? Perhaps animals that are asleep for longer periods of time are more vulnerable to poaching or predation...


```{r q1, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "What type of model should I use to answer this question?",
  answer("Supervised", correct = TRUE, message = "That's right! Since we have values for a response variable that we can use to build the model and calculate a loss/error, we would use supervised learning."),
  answer("Unsupervised", message = "Not quite. Unsupervised learning does not involve a response variable."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q2, echo=FALSE}
question_checkbox(
  "More specifically, which model(s) could I use?",
  answer("KNN",correct = TRUE,  message = "Correct! KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) is a classification algorithm which allows us to model binary response variables."),
  answer("Simple linear regression", message = "Not quite. Simple linear regression allows us to model a continuous response variable, not a binary response variable"),
  answer("Multiple linear regression", message = "Not quite. Multiple linear regresison will allow us to model a continuous response variable using multiple features, but our repsonse variable is binary."),
  answer("Logistic regression", correct = TRUE, message = "Correct! Logistic regression is a classification algorithm which allows us to model binary response variables."),
  answer("K-Means", message = "Not quite. K-Means is a method of clustering which is an unsupervised learning algorithm."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Try running KNN with different numbers of neighbors. Plot the training and the testing error across different values of K.

Discuss with your neighbor (or on Ed):
* What value of K would you choose? Why?
* For which values of K does the model underfit? Overfit?


### Clustering

Lastly, I'm curious if there are groups of animals who have similar features and whether or not these clusters are reflective of the greater taxonomy (using `genus` and `order`).

```{r q1, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "What type of model should I use to answer this question?",
  answer("Supervised", message = "Not quite. Since we are looking for groups with similar featuers, we want to use a clustering method. In clustering, there is no response variable."),
  answer("Unsupervised",correct = TRUE, message = "Correct!"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

In class, we learned about 2 clustering methods K-Means and Hierarchical clustering. 

Discuss with your neighbor (or on Ed):
* Which clustering method do you think makes the most sense for this dataset?

First, let's use K-Means to cluster the data.

Elbow plot to choose K.

For each cluster print the animals as well as their order and genus. Do you notice a pattern?

Now, let's use hierarchical clustering. Try a few different linkage and dissimilarity metrics and choose the one that creates the most balanced dendrogram. (The solution for this cell is just one of may potential choices. What we want you to do here is explore multiple choices and choose your favorite.)

For each cluster print the animals as well as their order and genus. Do you notice a pattern?

Discuss with your neighbor (or on Ed):
* Which clustering method do you feel produced the best clustering?
* Which clustering method produced a clustering that best separated the animals based on their order and genus?
